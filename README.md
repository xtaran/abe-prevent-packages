Axelâ€™s Installation Accident Prevention Packages
================================================

History
-------

There's a bunch of packages I usually try to keep off of most of my systems.

This includes most of the GNOME stuff with names ending in "Kit"
(PackageKit, PolicyKit and ConsoleKit), but also other GNOME-related
bloat like NetworkManager, PulseAudio, systemd and DBus.

For systemd there is the fine set of prevent-systemd-* packages from
Mirabilos at http://users.unixforge.de/~tglaser/debs/debidx.htm, so
I'm using those. This source packages includes similar packages for
those annoying tools, Mirabilos hasn't yet appropriate prevention
packages.
